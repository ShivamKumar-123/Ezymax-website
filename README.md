# Kalks

White-label multi-asset trading platform: three Next.js apps (Client Area CRM, Back Office admin, Kalks Trader terminal) plus a Rust market-data service for live prices, candles and spreads.
Live builds (default) show only real data; `NEXT_PUBLIC_KALKS_MODE=demo` builds show the full mock showcase (see `packages/mock/src/mode.ts`).

## Run locally

Requires Node 22+ and pnpm.

```bash
pnpm install        # also copies shared assets into each app
pnpm dev            # starts all apps
```

| App | URL |
|---|---|
| Client Area | http://localhost:3000 (sign-in at `/login`) |
| Back Office | http://localhost:3001 (staff sign-in at `/login`) |
| Kalks Trader (trading room) | http://localhost:3002 (opened from any **Trade** button, or MT5-style login at `/login`) |

Run a single app with `pnpm dev:crm`, `pnpm dev:admin` or `pnpm dev:terminal` (or `pnpm --filter @kalks/<crm|admin|terminal> dev`). Build with `pnpm build`.

## Market data

The Rust market-data service serves prices, candles and spreads to every app. It needs Rust (cargo) and PostgreSQL 16 listening on port 5433.

```bash
cargo run -p market-data            # http://127.0.0.1:8081
```

It creates its database and runs migrations on first start. Provider keys (`INFOWAY_*`) are read from `.env.local` at the repo root; never commit that file. Details, endpoints and settings: [services/market-data/README.md](services/market-data/README.md).

## Sign-in (gateway)

The Rust gateway handles client and staff sign-in, sessions and the audit log. It uses PostgreSQL on port 5433 (database `kalks_core`, created and migrated on first start).

```bash
cargo run -p gateway                # http://127.0.0.1:8080 (only the apps call it, never the browser)
```

Its settings (`GATEWAY_*`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `SUPER_ADMIN_*`) live in `.env.local` at the repo root, and each app's `.env.local` holds `GATEWAY_URL` and `GATEWAY_INTERNAL_TOKEN`. The super-admin account is created once on first start. The Back Office reads clients, the audit log, staff and sessions through the gateway's staff-authenticated `/v1/admin/*` endpoints (`services/gateway/src/admin.rs`), and edits spread markups through market-data with `MARKET_DATA_URL` / `MARKET_DATA_ADMIN_TOKEN` in `apps/admin/.env.local` (same token as `MARKET_DATA_ADMIN_TOKEN` in the root `.env.local`; see `apps/admin/.env.example`). Email sending is not configured yet, so in development the sign-in codes appear on screen and in the gateway log.

"Continue with Google" runs in the Client Area's route handlers (`apps/crm/app/api/auth/google/*`, `apps/crm/lib/google-oauth.ts`): state + PKCE + nonce, server-side code exchange, ID-token verification against Google's keys, then the gateway's `/v1/auth/google` endpoints. It needs `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_LOGIN=1` in `apps/crm/.env.local` (see `apps/crm/.env.example`), and the Google client must list `<origin>/api/auth/google/callback` as a redirect URI (`http://localhost:3000/...` for local testing). Tests: `cargo test -p gateway` and `pnpm --filter ./apps/crm test`.

## Identity verification (KYC)

Manual review by compliance staff with automatic pre-checks, in the gateway (`services/gateway/src/kyc.rs`, `kyc/staff.rs`). Clients verify at `/profile/verification` (Client Area BFF `apps/crm/app/api/kyc`): details, ID (camera with a frame guide or file), proof of address (< 3 months), selfie; corporate adds company details, directors / UBOs and their IDs. The browser checks sharpness, glare, lighting, framing, the passport MRZ and the face before upload; the gateway sniffs the file type, checks size, resolution and dates, flags files already used by another client, and stores each file AES-256-GCM encrypted under `KYC_STORAGE_DIR` (default `~/.kalks-data/kyc`) with `KYC_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (64 hex chars; development falls back to a key derived from `SESSION_SECRET`). Staff review at `/clients/kyc` (permissions `kyc.read` / `kyc.review`: admins and Compliance); documents stream only through the authenticated Back Office endpoint. Decisions set `users.kyc_status` (`verified` unlocks withdrawals, and locks name and date of birth), are audited, and email the client (logged as `DEV email` when SMTP isn't configured). `gateway kyc-erase-user <id>` removes a client's KYC files and rows.

## Trading engine

The Rust trading engine runs accounts, orders, positions, margin, swaps, the double-entry ledger and the dealing desk. It uses PostgreSQL on port 5433 (database `kalks_trading`, created and migrated on first start) and takes prices from market-data.

```bash
cargo run -p trading                # http://127.0.0.1:8090 (BFFs and internal services only)
cargo test -p trading
```

Its settings (`TRADING_*`) live in `.env.local` at the repo root. API, architecture and integration guide: [services/trading/README.md](services/trading/README.md).

## IB / referral programme

Every client is also an IB (partner). The Rust IB service mirrors the referral tree from the gateway, reads closed live deals from the trading engine, and computes multi-tier per-lot commissions, CPA bonuses, level upgrades, campaign funnels and payout batches that the Back Office approves into client wallets. It uses PostgreSQL on port 5433 (database `kalks_ib`, created and migrated on first start).

```bash
cargo run -p ib                    # http://127.0.0.1:8096 (BFFs and internal services only)
cargo test -p ib
```

Its settings (`IB_*`) live in `.env.local` at the repo root; the Client Area and Back Office need `IB_URL` / `IB_INTERNAL_TOKEN` in their `.env.local`. Partner links are `/r/CODE[/campaign]` on the Client Area. Rules, API and integration guide: [services/ib/README.md](services/ib/README.md).
