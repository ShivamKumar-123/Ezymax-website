# ib

The Ezymex IB / referral programme (Round 3, D53–D64). Every client is an IB from sign-up. The service mirrors the referral tree from the gateway, reads closed live deals from the trading engine, computes multi-tier per-lot commissions with client rebates and sub-IB splits, pays CPA bonuses, upgrades levels monthly, tracks campaign links, raises fraud flags, and pays approved batches into client wallets. It is a Rust service (axum 0.8, sqlx 0.9, PostgreSQL) on `127.0.0.1:8096`.

## Run locally

You need PostgreSQL on `127.0.0.1:5433` (user `postgres`, trust auth), the gateway on `:8080` and the trading engine on `:8090`. The wallet on `:8095` is optional: without it, approved payouts wait in `transfer_pending` and are retried.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
cargo build -p ib
(cd services/ib && IB_LOG_FORMAT=pretty nohup ../../target/debug/ib > ~/.ezymex-local/ib.log 2>&1 &)
curl -s localhost:8096/health
cargo test -p ib
```

On first start the service creates the `ezymex_ib` database, runs `migrations/`, and seeds the default programme (settings and the Bronze → Diamond levels) for tenant `ezymex`. It reads `IB_*`, `GATEWAY_INTERNAL_TOKEN`, `TRADING_INTERNAL_TOKEN` and `WALLET_INTERNAL_TOKEN` from the repo-root `.env.local`.

## How it works

```
 gateway /v1/internal/referrals/users ──(keyset cursor, every 10 s)──► members (tree, signals)
 engine  /v1/dealing/deals ──(close-time cursor + 2 min overlap, every 5 s)──► deals ─► commission lines
 engine  /v1/admin/accounts, /v1/accounts/{login}/ledger ──► account kind/group/cent, first deposit (CPA)
 copy/PAMM service ──POST /v1/ib/events/lots──► deals (source pamm|copy)
 wallet service    ──POST /v1/ib/events/deposit──► first deposit (CPA)
 scheduler ──► payout batch (pending approval) ──admin approve──► POST wallet /v1/wallets/transfers (ib_payout)
```

| Loop | Period | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| gateway-sync | `IB_SYNC_SECS` (10 s) | pulls new and changed clients; sets upline and campaign once (permanent attribution); re-checks self-referral signals against the upline |
| engine-deals | `IB_DEALS_SECS` (5 s) | polls closing deals per tenant, processes each once |
| deposits | 60 s | first live deposit of referred clients who don't have one yet (each client at most every 5 min) |
| reversals | 10 min | deals the dealing desk reopened in the last 14 days: void or claw back their commission |
| auto-batches | 5 min | when a payout period has closed, creates its batch for approval (once per period) |
| payouts | 30 s, or at once on approval | credits approved payouts to wallets; retries with backoff (1, 2, 4 … 60 min) |
| levels | hourly | on the first run of a month, evaluates last month and promotes IBs |

**Engine deals feed (gap).** The engine has no "deals since cursor" endpoint. `GET /v1/dealing/deals?from&to&limit` returns closing deals newest first, at most 2000, without the account type, cent flag or order source. The poller keeps the last close time it saw, re-reads a 2-minute overlap (a deal's time is stamped before its shard commits), and pages backwards with `to` when a window is full. Idempotency is per deal, so overlap is free. Account type / group / cent come from `GET /v1/admin/accounts/{login}` (cached for an hour). Reopened deals are found by a 14-day re-scan. A dedicated engine feed — `GET /v1/dealing/deals?after_id=&limit=` in id order, including `accountType`, `cent`, `group` and `source`, plus reopen events — would replace the overlap, the per-login lookups and the re-scan.

## Programme rules

| Area | Rule |
|---|---|
| Membership (D53) | Every gateway client is a member at the entry level (rank 1) with a referral code (the gateway's `referral_code`: `EZ` + 6 characters, no name in it since 2026-10-10; the old first-name code is kept as `referral_code_legacy` and still resolves) |
| Active links (2026-10-10) | The gateway attributes a sign-up to the referrer only once the referrer has deposited (wallet `GET /v1/internal/users/{id}/funded`); before that the sign-up has no upline here and the referrer gets an `ib.referral_inactive` notification. No partner exemption: every client is a partner from sign-up |
| Attribution (D63) | The upline is the gateway's `referred_by` at sign-up, set once. Only an admin reassignment changes it (audited, loop-checked). The campaign (`referral_campaign`) is attributed when it is one of that IB's campaign slugs |
| Qualifying deal (D54, D59) | Closed deal on a **live** account, not in an excluded group (default `prop`), not reopened, not a price-correction deal, held ≥ `minTradeSeconds` (default 120 s), client has an upline and no self-referral block, symbol maps to a symbol group |
| Lots | Deal volume in lots; cent accounts × `centLotFactor` (0.01) |
| Options (O34) | A Ezymex FX Options deal (`instrument: "option"` / `option` in the engine feed, or an option series symbol `EURUSD-20261009-1.1650-C`) is paid **per contract**: tier *k* IB earns `contracts × optionsRate(its level) × tiers[k] %`, with the same rebates, splits, caps and filters as CFD deals. `optionsRate` (USD per contract, round turn, paid on the closing deal: close, expiry or knock-out) is set per level in the Back Office and is **0 by default**, so options earn nothing until the broker sets it. CFD per-lot rates are never applied to an option deal. Contracts are not scaled on cent accounts and are **never lots**: option deals have 0 lots, so they never count toward `minMonthlyLots` or lot statistics (they do make a client active) |
| Symbol groups | Explicit symbol lists first (forex majors), then the asset class from `config/instruments.json` |
| Tier amounts (D55) | Tier *k* IB: `lots × rate(its level, symbol group) × tiers[k] %`, rounded to cents. Default tiers 100 / 20 / 10 |
| Splits (D60) | An IB at tier *k ≥ 2* passes `splitPct` of its own tier amount to the IB below it in that chain |
| Rebates (D60) | The tier-1 IB passes `rebatePct` of its tier-1 amount to the trading client |
| Caps | Rebate and split are capped by `maxRebatePct` / `maxSplitPct`; splits and rebates only move money between lines, the total equals the sum of the tier amounts |
| Suspended IB | Earns nothing, gives nothing |
| CPA (D57) | Once per client, to the tier-1 IB: first live deposit ≥ `cpa.minFirstDeposit` and (if required) a first qualifying trade. Amount = the IB level's `cpaAmount`. Payable after `holdDays` |
| First deposit | The oldest `deposit` / `transfer_in` on any of the client's live accounts (engine ledger), or a deposit event pushed by the wallet; the earliest wins |
| Levels (D58) | On the 1st of each month: highest level whose `minActiveClients` (tier-1 clients with a qualifying deal that month) **and** `minMonthlyLots` (qualifying lots of the whole network, all tiers) are met. Promotions only unless `allowDemotion`; `levelLocked` members are skipped |
| PAMM / copy (D64) | Lots allocated to a referred investor are pushed with `POST /v1/ib/events/lots` and earn like the investor's own trades |
| Payouts (D56) | Pending lines available before the period end are grouped per payee into a batch (payees below `payout.minAmount` or net ≤ 0 carry over). Approve → lines `approved`, payouts `transfer_pending` → wallet credit (`kind: ib_payout`, idempotency key `ib:payout:<tenant>:<batch>:<user>`) → `paid`. Reject → lines back to the pending pool |
| Reversal | A reopened deal's unbatched pending lines are voided; lines already batched or paid get a negative `clawback` line that nets off the next payout |
| Self-referral (D59) | Identity (keyed hash of name + date of birth, and of the phone), device hash and IP (loopback ignored) of the client vs its upline. Each signal: `block` (flag + no commission from that client until an admin dismisses), `flag`, or `off` |
| Wash trading | Opposite, similar-volume (±10 %) trades on the same symbol by the IB or two clients of the same IB, opened and closed within 60 s of each other → flag. ≥ 10 sub-minimum trades making ≥ 50 % of a client's trades in 24 h → `short_trades` flag |
| Visibility (D61) | `clientVisibility: masked` (default since 2026-10-10; migration 0004 switched brokers that were on `full`) shows IBs initials ("A. M."), client ids, country, dates and totals only, and their client search matches ids and country, never names; `full` also shows names, emails, first deposit amounts and trades (consent in the sign-up T&C) |

Money is `rust_decimal` everywhere and `NUMERIC` in the database; every line is rounded to cents half away from zero.

## Data model

Database `ezymex_ib` (`migrations/0001_ib.sql`). Every row has `tenant` (gateway tenant slug).

| Table | Contents |
|---|---|
| `settings` | programme settings per tenant (JSON, versioned) |
| `levels` | name, rank, rates per symbol group, `options_rate` (USD per option contract, default 0), CPA amount, upgrade targets, perks |
| `members` | every client: upline (`parent_id`, source signup/admin), campaign, level, rebate/split %, status, self-referral state, identity/device/IP signals, first deposit / first trade |
| `campaigns`, `clicks` | campaign links per IB; clicks with a keyed visitor hash (no raw IP), unique per visitor per 24 h |
| `accounts` | engine account kind / group / cent cache |
| `deals` | every processed deal, qualified or not, with the reason; `(source, deal_id, user_id)` primary key = idempotency; `instrument` (`cfd` / `option`), `lots` (0 for options) and `contracts` |
| `commissions` | lines: `lot`, `split`, `rebate`, `cpa`, `clawback`, `adjustment`; status `pending → approved → paid` or `rejected` / `void`; unique per (deal, client, beneficiary, kind) and one CPA per client. Option lines: `symbol_group = 'options'`, `lots` 0, `contracts`, `rate` = the per-contract rate |
| `payout_batches`, `payouts` | batches and one payout per payee, with transfer attempts, last error, wallet txn |
| `fraud_flags` | open / confirmed / dismissed, deduplicated |
| `reassignments`, `level_history` | append-only history |
| `audit_log` | append-only (trigger), every admin change and money decision |
| `cursors` | poller cursors and once-per-period markers |

## API

Every route except `GET /health` needs `X-Ezymex-Internal: $IB_INTERNAL_TOKEN`. Tenant: `X-Ezymex-Tenant` (default `ezymex`). JSON camelCase; money and lots are JSON numbers (programme settings return decimals as strings and accept numbers or strings). Errors: `{"error": {"code", "message", "field"?}}` with 400 `bad_request`, 401 `unauthorized`, 403 `forbidden`, 404 `not_found`, 409 `not_ready` | `exists` | `invalid_state` | `nothing_to_pay` | `no_change` | `limit`, 422 `validation`, 503 `unavailable`.

**Public / services**

| Method & path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|

## How the apps integrate

| App / service | Integration |
|---|---|
| **Gateway** | `GET /v1/internal/referrals/users?since&after_id&limit` (internal token) in `(changed_at, id)` order. Sign-up (`/v1/auth/register`, `/v1/auth/google/complete`) takes `referral_campaign` next to `referral_code` |
| **Client Area** | `proxy.ts`: `/r/CODE[/campaign]` and any `?ref=CODE&c=campaign` record a click (`POST /v1/ib/clicks`, 1.5 s budget), set the first-party `ezymex_ref` cookie and send signed-out visitors to `/register?ref=…`. The register and Google-complete BFFs add `referral_campaign` from the cookie when the code matches. `/api/partner/*` → `/v1/ib/me/*` |
| **Back Office** | `/api/partners/*` → `/v1/ib/admin/*` with permissions `partners.read / write / approve` (`apps/admin/lib/partners-perms.ts`) |
| **Wallet** | The IB service calls `POST /v1/wallets/transfers` (`direction: credit`, `kind: ib_payout`, `currency: USDT`). The wallet may call `POST /v1/ib/events/deposit` on confirmed deposits |
| **Support** | After each payout step, paid payouts not yet announced go to `POST $SUPPORT_URL/v1/notify` as `ib.commission_paid` (link `/partner/payouts`, `dedupeKey ib:payout:<id>:paid`): bell in the Client Area and Ezymex Trader, email per the partner's `ib` preference. Retries back off (`payouts.notify_attempts`, `notify_error`) and never hold a payout back |
| **Copy / PAMM** | Push investor allocations with `POST /v1/ib/events/lots` when the master deal closes (not for trades on the investor's own account, which are read from the engine) |
| **Website** | Partner links should point to the Client Area (`https://app.<domain>/r/CODE/campaign`), or pass `?ref=&c=` through to it |

## Environment

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `IB_BIND` | `127.0.0.1:8096` | |
| `IB_DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5433/ezymex_ib` | created and migrated on first start |
| `IB_INTERNAL_TOKEN` | – | required when `IB_ENV=production`; also set in the CRM and admin `.env*.local` |
| `IB_ENV` | `development` | |
| `GATEWAY_URL` / `GATEWAY_INTERNAL_TOKEN` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | referral feed |
| `TRADING_URL` / `TRADING_INTERNAL_TOKEN` | `http://127.0.0.1:8090` | deals, accounts, ledgers |
| `WALLET_URL` / `WALLET_INTERNAL_TOKEN` | `http://127.0.0.1:8095` | payout credits |
| `SUPPORT_URL` / `SUPPORT_INTERNAL_TOKEN` | `http://127.0.0.1:8100` / – | `ib.commission_paid` notifications; empty URL = none |
| `INSTRUMENTS_FILE` | `config/instruments.json` | asset classes for symbol groups |
| `IB_SYNC_SECS` / `IB_DEALS_SECS` | `10` / `5` | poll periods |
| `IB_WORKERS` | `true` | `false` serves the API only |
| `IB_LOG_FORMAT` | `json` | `json` or `pretty` |

Production runs `deploy/systemd/ezymex-ib.service`. `deploy/deploy.sh` builds it, generates `IB_INTERNAL_TOKEN` once, derives `IB_DATABASE_URL` from `GATEWAY_DATABASE_URL` with the database `ezymex_ib`, and writes `IB_URL` / `IB_INTERNAL_TOKEN` into the CRM and admin `.env.production.local`.

## Tests

```bash
cargo test -p ib
```

- **Unit** (`calc`, `model`): option deals per contract and never lots, the options rate (default 0, validation, kept when absent), option series codes, per-lot amounts, three tiers with shares, rebate + split within the IB's own amount, caps, suspended IBs, rounding conservation, tiny deals, anti-abuse filters (demo, excluded group, reopened, price correction, minimum duration), cent lots, level evaluation (both targets, lock, demotion), wash-pair matching, payout periods, backoff, symbol groups, settings validation.
- **Database** (`tests/programme.rs`, throw-away `ezymex_ib_test_*` database, skipped without PostgreSQL): option deals paid per contract only (rate 0 by default = no lines; the Back Office rate card through `PUT levels`, kept when a PUT omits it; tier %, rebate; short / demo / reopened filters; 0 lots, so level upgrades ignore them; a series pushed as PAMM / copy lots; feed parsing), multi-tier lines with rebate and split, the same deal twice (no double pay), a three-tier chain, short / demo / prop / no-referrer deals, PAMM lots, deals that arrive before the client is mirrored; self-referral block and admin clearing, loopback IPs ignored, wash-pair flag; CPA only after a deposit ≥ minimum and a trade, once; batch creation with carry-over, approval, a wallet that fails once (pending transfer, same idempotency key on retry, then paid), clawback after a paid deal is reopened, void of an unpaid one; batch rejection releasing lines; click tracking (unique per visitor, unknown campaign, unknown code); old codes still tracking after the switch to name-free codes; masked visibility (no name, email or first deposit amount in the dashboard, clients, network or commissions; search by id / country only; trades closed) and the one-off switch of `full` brokers to `masked`.

## Known gaps

- **Engine feed.** See [How it works](#how-it-works): polling with overlap, per-login account lookups and a 14-day reversal re-scan instead of an ordered deals feed with account type and source.
- **Deposits.** First deposits come from engine ledgers (`deposit`, `transfer_in`) or a wallet push. Until the wallet pushes `POST /v1/ib/events/deposit`, a deposit that stays in the wallet without reaching a trading account doesn't count toward CPA or FTD.
- **KYC identity.** The identity signal is a keyed hash of name + date of birth and of the phone number from the gateway, not the verified document number; the KYC service can add document hashes to the referral feed later.
- **Order source.** Deals from the engine don't carry `source`, so copy-trading fills on an investor's own account aren't labelled as copy in the ledger (they do earn).
- **Banners / landing pages.** Campaign links point to a Client Area path; tenant banner and landing-page assets are not managed here.
- **Scale.** Network lots and client lists use recursive queries per request; fine for thousands of members, a materialised network table is the next step.
