/**
 * Back Office finance permissions for the wallet (deposits, withdrawals, client wallets, reconciliation,
 * wallet settings).
 *
 * The gateway's role → permission matrix (services/gateway/src/admin.rs) has no finance permissions yet, so the
 * admin BFF owns this map, like lib/trading-perms.ts does for trading. It mirrors the role checks the wallet
 * service enforces itself (services/wallet/src/state.rs: ROLES_READ / ROLES_WRITE / ROLES_APPROVE /
 * ROLES_SETTINGS); the BFF checks first and the UI hides what the role can't use.
 *
 * When the gateway starts returning these for a role (any "finance.read" entry in `/v1/admin/auth/me` →
 * permissions), that list wins and this map is no longer consulted. To move them into the gateway, add
 * FinanceRead / FinanceWrite / FinanceApprove / FinanceSettings to `Perm` with the rows below.
