/**
 * Back Office Marketing permissions (services/growth: bonuses, promo codes, banners, contests, loyalty, cashback).
 *
 * The gateway RBAC (services/gateway/src/rbac.rs) defines marketing.read / write / approve and returns them in the
 * staff session (`rbac: true`); that list always wins, custom roles included. This map is the fallback for sessions
 * without RBAC. The BFF forwards the resolved permissions to the growth service in `X-Kalks-Staff-Perms`, which
 * checks them again (role lists below when the header is absent).
