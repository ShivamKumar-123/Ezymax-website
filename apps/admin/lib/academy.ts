/**
 * Back Office Academy CMS: permissions and the server-only client for services/academy (127.0.0.1:8098).
 *
 * The gateway's role → permission matrix has no content permissions yet, so the admin BFF owns this map. When
 * the gateway starts returning "content.*" permissions for a role (`/v1/admin/auth/me` → permissions), that
 * list wins and this map is no longer consulted.
 *
 * | permission    | what it allows                                                                 | roles                                          |
 * |---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
 * | content.read  | course tree, chapters, quizzes, exams, glossary, learner stats, edit history   | every staff role except dealer, risk_manager   |
 * | content.write | edit / create chapters, quizzes and exams, publish / unpublish, reorder, reset | platform_owner, super_admin, admin, marketing  |
 *
 * Edits are copy-on-write overrides for the staff member's tenant; the platform default comes from the
 * versioned files in content/academy (seeded by the service on start).
