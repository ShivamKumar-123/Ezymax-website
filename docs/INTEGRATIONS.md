# Kalks: integrations checklist (founder guide)

This is every external service Kalks connects to, what the Super Admin has to paste in, where to get it, and whether you need it on launch day.

It mirrors **Back Office → Settings → Integrations** (`/settings/integrations`), where each item has a card with the same fields, a **Test connection** button and a docs link. The page data lives in `packages/mock/src/admin-platform-settings.ts` (`SET_INTEGRATIONS`), so keep both in sync.

**How secrets are handled:**
- All secrets are encrypted at rest (AES-256, KMS envelope keys) and shown masked.
- Every change is written to the immutable admin audit log.
- White-label tenants inherit these defaults. Enterprise tenants can bring their own email, SMS and KYC credentials.

**Launch levels:**
- **Required:** you cannot go live without it.
- **Recommended:** launch works without it, but in a degraded or fallback mode.
- **Optional:** nice to have.
- **Post-launch:** intentionally off at launch.

---

## 1. Market data feed: Infoways · Required
Real-time quotes for all asset classes. The feed drives the pricing engine, the terminals and the Client Area.

| Symbols mapping | Managed in **Brokers → Global symbols** (Kalks symbol ↔ feed symbol). |
| Backup feed provider | None / Twelve Data / Polygon.io / Finnhub |
| Backup feed API key (secret) | From the backup provider's dashboard |

**Where to get it:** Infoways client portal → API → Keys. Sign the redistribution agreement first.

## 2. Transactional email · Required
Handles the Welcome, OTP, deposit, withdrawal, KYC and margin-call emails. The templates themselves are in **Content → Email templates**.

**Where to get it:**
1. In the AWS console, go to SES and verify the domain `kalks.com`.
2. Go to SMTP settings and create SMTP credentials.
3. In your DNS, add the SPF, DKIM and DMARC records. The card shows whether each one passes.

## 3. SMS & WhatsApp OTP · Required
Sends the codes for sign-up, withdrawals and the 2FA fallback. WhatsApp goes first; SMS is the fallback.

|---|---|
| Provider | Twilio / MSG91 / Gupshup |

## 4. KYC verification: Sumsub · Required

## 5. USDT-TRC20 blockchain: TronGrid · Required
Covers the whole USDT flow:

- Sweeps to the hot wallet
- Withdrawals

| Field | Example / notes |
|---|---|
| TronGrid API key (secret) | trongrid.io dashboard |
| Full node URL | `https://api.trongrid.io`, or your own node |
| Hot wallet address | `TQ7x…9KfE`. Keep TRX in it for energy/bandwidth. |
| HD xpub (secret) | Extended **public** key used to derive deposit addresses. Never paste a private key or seed. |
| Confirmations required | `20` blocks |
| Sweep threshold | `500` USDT |
| Cold wallet address | Treasury address that receives overflow above the hot-wallet cap |

**Where to get it:**
- The API key comes from trongrid.io.

- The cold wallet address comes from treasury.

Changes to wallet fields require four-eyes approval.

## 6. Object storage: S3 / MinIO · Required

**Where to get it:** AWS IAM (or the MinIO console). Create the bucket, then create an access key scoped to that bucket.

## 7. AI assistant: Anthropic Claude · Recommended
Powers three features:
- The support bot, which answers first and hands over to human agents.
- The AI coach.
- Knowledge-base search.

| Field | Example / notes |
|---|---|
| Claude API key (secret) | `sk-ant-api03-…` |
| Model | `claude-sonnet-5` (default) |
| Monthly budget | e.g. `3000` USD. The bot hands off to human agents when the budget is reached. |

**Where to get it:** console.anthropic.com → Settings → API keys. Also set a workspace spend limit there.

**Without it:** support runs human-only and AI features are hidden.

## 8. Error monitoring: Sentry · Recommended

## 11. Google sign-in · Optional
"Continue with Google" on the Client Area sign-in and sign-up pages (D27). New Google users finish a short profile step (country, phone, date of birth, referral code, terms) before the account is created; their email counts as verified.

| Field | Example / notes |
|---|---|
| Client ID | `…apps.googleusercontent.com` → `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in `apps/crm/.env.production.local` |
| Client secret (secret) | `GOCSPX-…` → `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `apps/crm/.env.production.local` |
| Show the button | `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_LOGIN=1` in the same file (read at build time, so rebuild after changing it) |
| Authorised redirect URI | `https://app.kalkstrade.com/api/auth/google/callback` (add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback` too if you want to test locally) |
| Authorised JavaScript origin | not needed (the flow is server-side) |

**Where to get it:** Google Cloud console → APIs & Services → Credentials → OAuth client ID (Web application). On the OAuth consent screen, use the scopes `openid`, `email` and `profile` only, add the app name, logo, support email, and the privacy policy and terms links, then publish the app ("In production"). While it is in "Testing", only the listed test users can sign in.

## 12. Web analytics & pixels · Optional

## 13. Liquidity provider: FIX 4.4 · Post-launch (disabled)
